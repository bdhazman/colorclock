# What does it do?
Depending on the time of day the background of the page will change.
Additionally, the text shown will show the color that represents the current time. The text itself's color is the inverse of whatever color is displayed.
In one day, the page's background will have gone through the complete color spectrum.

# How does it work?
The color that is shown is based off an algorithm where

hours correlate to the amount of red in the background's color,

minutes correlate to the amount of green in the color,

and seconds to the amount of blue in the color.
